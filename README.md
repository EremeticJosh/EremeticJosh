- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EremeticJosh My full name is Joshua Ricardo I am a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University, with my Bachelors in Game Programming and Development.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in gaining to news to become a better programmer and overall better person. My goal someday is to eventually be able to create games that help make people feel better.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work better within Unreal and Unity, as well has daddle into the more techical side of code. These include things such as Angular/Python and so on.
- I am looking to gain more knowledge and while at this moment I do lack a lot of actual work experience, my skills and dedication towards making great games and work are my passion. Thus, I know that my ability to work within a group and take cristism will be the bonus for those that do hire me.
